1. dequeue
Let Q be a Queue data structure and it has ‘n ‘ elements.  A D_QUE is a double ended queue and it allows insertion and deletion at both ends.  Assume X1, X2, …, Xn  are n-positive integers.  Write an algorithm  and subsequent C code to insert element all even numbers at one end of a  D_QUE and  all odd integers at another end  of a D_QUE.

Input format
Enter the size of queue ‘n’
Insert the ‘n’ elements in the D_QUE

Output format
Print elements from D_QUE

5.queue1
Let Q be a Queue data structure and it has ‘n ‘ elements. Write a program to print elements  from the Queue  Q which are greater than p . Print “no” if every element of the Queue is  less than or equal to p.  For example, your code produces output  44, 15 if the queue Q has   10, 2,13,44,15 ( assume 10 is the front element of the queue) elements  and p=14.  Note: Use Enqueue and Dequeue operations only.
